# First Chapter: Design to Deploy

Using the UnWorkshop project as the anchoring scenario, this chapter explains key design phases. 

Iteration ensures the final project meets expectations and achieves intended goals. Iteration happens between the team and project owners, users and other stakeholders periodically.  Iteration also happens among members of the project team who get feedback on their work and make everything fit.  


## Who Does What

### The Team

The project team consists of two or more people working collaboratively to build a final product.  

### The Owner

At the start of a project, it is important to identify the project owner or their representative. The input to the entire production cycle is an owner's request for some intended final product or other output.  The project owner provides an initial description of the expected final product. 

The project owner and project team should agree upon clear criteria and measures of project success at the project start.  

### The Product

The product is what a project team produces. A product is some new thing of value such as a mobile app, text book or music album. The project organizes resources for the team to build and deliver a final product. 

The final product is often called a deliverable in contracts. The project team delivers the final project to the owner. When the owner and team agree a delivered product meets or exceeds expectations then the product is final. The word "deliver" is frequently more conceptual than literal. A digital final product is typically handed off to another team who may further develop or deploy it for the owner. 


### The Users 

Users are individuals who directly operate or interact with a product.  A customer who listens to music on an app and a student who submits homework through a class website are software users. Identifying users is important for the success of a project.  User testing of interim product versions can be an invaluable source of feedback.  Users can also reveal important product requirements otherwise unknown to the owner and team. 

### The Stakeholders

Other stakeholders could include manufacturers, investors, former customers or even regulators of the product.  The project plan should define the role of other stakeholders involved in product approval.


### Project Plan

The project plan provides a simple, single and shared source of key information. This project plan keeps everybody on the same page from start to finish. The project plan should reflect the most up to date and agreed:  
* Product definition
* Project roles
* Schedule and milestones
* Success criteria and measures
* Key links and contact information

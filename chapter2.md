# Staging and Phasing the Cycles of Design

Each design cycle serves an important purpose.  Combining these cycles in this sequence is a common way to complete a web project. The intended outputs of each cycle serve as inputs to later cycles. Work on the outputs of two or more cycles can happen simultaneously to some extent. 

### Wireframe Mockups

Sketch key screens and flows

### HTML/CSS Design

Expected display and behavior using dummy data

### Backend Services
